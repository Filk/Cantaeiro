# Cantaeiro

Cant(a)eiro is an ongoing project that proposes to investigate the potential of congregating plants with current computer technologies as a catalyst for musical creation with children within school environments.
This software was developed to allow children and teachers to interact with the hardware! It features the possibility to play sounds automatically or manually, to programm specific (musical) behaviours and to write information about the plant with which it is interacting.
With this research we will provide inspiring ideas to pump up musical creation in which plants and children interact and are both actively contributing to the soundscape of its environment.

Developed at Orquestra Jazz de Matosinhos and CIPEM (Research Center in Psychology of Music and Music Education) - Branch of INET-md (Institute of Ethnomusicology â€“Studies in music and dance) at the Porto Polytechnic
